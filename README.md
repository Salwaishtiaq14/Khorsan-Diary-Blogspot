Project Description:
In this project, I enhanced and redesigned a user-friendly web interface with a focus on intuitive navigation and a seamless user experience. The front end was built using HTML and CSS, ensuring responsiveness across all devices. This project showcases my ability to transform UI/UX concepts into functional, visually appealing web pages with clean, efficient code. The interface includes three key pages:
- Home Page
- Article Page
- Opinion Page
